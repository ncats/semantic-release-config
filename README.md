[![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

Shared configuration for Semantic Release. 
Details: [shared-config](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/shareable-configurations.md).

## Available Configurations
Labshare repositories can use the following configurations:

## Default: 
Defined in `index.js` file, loaded by default when requiring `@labshare/semantic-release-config`. Used by both client-side and server-side projects, contains the standard release procedure for semantic-release.

### Usage Instructions:
  * Install this module as `devDependency`: `npm i @labshare/semantic-release-config --save-dev`
  * Add to your [semantic-release config](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md) file: 
```
{
  "extends": "@labshare/semantic-release-config"
}
```

## Angular Lib:
Defined in `angular-lib.js` file, specific for Angular Libraries. Loaded by default when requiring `@labshare/semantic-release-config/angular-lib` and adapted for the following requirements:

* Angular Libraries are built with [NgPackagr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-packagr). During `build` step (`npm run build:lib`), NgPackagr will create a new folder for the bundled package (`/dist`, by default). This happens because:
  * Several bundle types will be compiled - FESM2015, FESM5, UMD, Minified UMD bundle, etc.
  * Package metadata will be altered - "main", "module", "es2015" and other fields will be created; npm scripts will be removed (security vulnerabilities)
  * Extra Dependencies might be necessary and will be added automatically.
  * Package Typings and Metadata will be generated by Ngc AOT and exported automatically. 

In order for NgPackagr and Semantic-Release integrate correctly, some adjustments have been made necessary:

* Npm released package should **only** contain the bundle inside `/dist`
* Semantic-release plugin will automatically update `package.json` and `package-lock.json` versions to reflect updates on Git repository after a release. However, since the default folder is now `/dist`, this specific configuration has to update root `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files with customized scripts.

### Usage Instructions:

In your Angular Library repository:
  * Install [ngPackagr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-packagr) as `devDependency` and [configure it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-packagr#usage-example)

  * Make sure you have `build:lib` script configured to call `ng-packagr` in the repo to be built,
  as well as `semantic-release` script.
  
  * Install this module as `devDependency`: `npm i @labshare/semantic-release-config --save-dev`

  * Add to your [semantic-release config](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md) file: 
```
{
  "extends": "@labshare/semantic-release-config/angular-lib"
}
```
  * Setup your Travis.yml release to call the release script contained in this repository. E.g.:

```yml
jobs:
  include:
    - stage: release
      if: branch = master
      node_js: lts/*
      script: skip
      deploy:
        provider: script
        skip_cleanup: true
        script:
          - bash node_modules/@labshare/semantic-release-config/scripts/release.sh
```
